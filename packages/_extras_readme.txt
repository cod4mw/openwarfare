The folders under the Extras directory contain different files
to help the admins adjust their servers according to their
gameplay style.


"Stock weapons" 
  The z_openwarfare.iwd file in this folder contains the stock
  weapons with their fixes and with their stock sway enabled
  which has been found to cause hit detection issues in mods.

"Snipers with increased distance"
  The z_openwarfare.iwd file in this folder increases the distance
  for the sniper rifles. Most of the time this file is used in
  sniper-only servers that run long sniper custom maps. When this
  file is used the distance of the snipers rifles will be increased
  but they will not be able to shoot through walls, foliage, etc.
  This file should replace the default z_openwarfare.iwd included
  in the mod.

"The Company Hub Weapons"
	The z_openwarfare.iwd file in this folder changes the behavior 
	of all the weapons in the game to make more realistic. There are
	some very interesting tweaks in these weapons. If you are searching
	for a more realistic experience give these weapons a try. This file
	should replace the default z_openwarfare.iwd included in the mod.

"Longer Smoke"
	The mod.ff file in this folder changes the length of the smoke
	grenades in the game. By default the smoke grenades will last for
	about 10 seconds or so. This file increases the length of the smoke
	grenades to about 25 seconds or so. This file	should replace the 
	default mod.ff included in the mod.
