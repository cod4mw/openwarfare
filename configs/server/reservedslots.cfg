// Enable the reserved slots system. The reserved slots system needs an extra 
// slot on the server so for example, if you are running the server for 20 players
// you will need to increase it to 21. The reserved slot system will keep this
// extra slot empty to allow players to connect always to the server and decide
// which player should be redirected or kicked out of the server. Kicked or
// redirected players will see a message on screen before any action is taken.
// 0 = Disabled (default), 1 = Enabled
// set scr_reservedslots_enable "0"

// Amount of slots that will be reserved for clan members (total amount of slots means only 
// clan members will be able to connect to this server)
// Allowed values: 1 - 64 (default is 1)
// set scr_reservedslots_amount "1"

// GUIDs with their respective priority. This variable can be used to give to 
// specific players a higher priority within the clan members. Senior admins or
// clan founders can then have a higher priority than clan members. Multiple lines
// are allowed (please use up to 1000 characters before adding a new line).
// Format is "<guid>=<priority>;<guid>=<priority>;..." (priority can be any number from 1 to 100).
// set scr_reservedslots_guids_1 ""

// Clan tags that will get an additional priority of 100
// Format is "<tag> <tag> ..." (default is empty)
// set scr_reservedslots_clantags ""

// Server IP address where players being disconnected will be redirected to. If this
// IP address is not set then players will just be disconnected from the server to
// make room for clan members.
// Format is "<ip address>:<port number>"
// set scr_reservedslots_redirectip ""
