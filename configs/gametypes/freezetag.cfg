// GAMETYPE DESCRIPTION
//******************************************************************************
// In Freeze Tag two teams fight each other to completely freeze the other team.
//
// The difference between Freeze Tag and Team Deathmatch is that in Freeze Tag
// players will be frozen when killed and their teammates need to unfreeze
// them to come back into the game. If a team successfully freezes all the
// players on the other side then the team wins the round.
//
// To unfreeze players their teammates will need to get close to them or point to
// them and press the USE key to give them health again (body temperature). Once the
// player reaches the maximum health he/she will be unfrozen.
