// GAMETYPE DESCRIPTION
//******************************************************************************
// In Behind Enemy Lines two teams fight each other. However, one team (the runners)
// are over powered by the other team (the hunters) about 1:3-4. Runners will
// receive extra points for staying alive. If a hunter kills a runner that
// hunter will become a runner and the runner will become a hunter.
// The player that reaches the score limit or the player with the highest score
// at the end of the game wins.
