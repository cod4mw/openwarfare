// GAMETYPE DESCRIPTION
//******************************************************************************
// In Search and Destroy there two teams. Attackers and defenders.
//
// Attackers need to plant a bomb at the other team's bombsites and defend it so it's
// not defused by the defenders.
//
// Defenders need to defend their bombsites to prevent the attackers from planting 
// the bomb and defuse it in case they do accomplish to plant it.
//
// This is an elimination gametype so there's not respawn and a team will also
// win the round if it successfully eliminates the other team.
