// GAMETYPE DESCRIPTION
//******************************************************************************
// In Headquarters players on both teams need to capture the objective once 
// active and defend it for certain amount of time to gain points. Once a team
// captures the objective the team will receive certain amount of points every
// 5 seconds.
//
// There are two modes in Headquarters. In Mode 0, once the objective is captured
// by one team the objective will respawn in another location once it's destroyed
// but the other team. In Mode 1, once the objective has been capture by one team
// it can be re-captured by the other team and it will not re-spawn in another
// location thus both teams can score points until the objective is automatically
// relocated by the game.
